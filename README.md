# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Lemaire

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a student at CentraleSupélec, passionate about applied AI and machine learning—especially where it intersects with real-world systems, human behavior, and brain-inspired computation.

## 🌱 What I’m working on
- 🧠 **Neural Resume Parser** — BERT + T5 fine-tuned for robust PDF CV parsing (NER + text normalization).
- ♟️ **VoiceChess** — an experimental interface for blindfold chess using speech recognition and a Stockfish fallback engine.

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages**: Python (Advanced), C++, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Tools**: Docker, Git, Jupyter, OpenCV, SQL, VS Code
- **ML & NLP**: BERT, T5, XGBoost, MFCC, Speech Emotion Recognition, Reservoir Computing

## 🚀 What drives me
- A fascination with how intelligence emerges—whether in brains, code, or systems.
- A strong interest in finance and trading (currently taking Yale's *Financial Markets* course).
- A long-term goal to work at the intersection of AI and investment management (private equity, quant research...).

## 📫 Let’s connect
If you're working on similar topics, hiring for internships, or just want to chat about AI, chess, or neuromorphic computing—I'd love to connect!
