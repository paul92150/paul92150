# Paul Lemaire

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm currently a student at CentraleSupélec, passionate about applied machine learning—particularly at the intersection of real-world systems, human decision-making, and brain-inspired computation.

## Current Projects

- **Neural Resume Parser** – A PDF CV parsing pipeline that combines fine-tuned BERT for named entity recognition with a T5-based text normalization module. Built for robustness across diverse document formats.
- **VoiceChess** – A blindfold chess interface that uses speech recognition and dynamically switches between human move modeling and Stockfish. Includes a visual board, PGN export, and fallback to engine evaluation.
- **Trading-Lab** – A modular Python framework for exploring algorithmic trading strategies.

## Technical Skills

- **Languages**: Python (Advanced), C++
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Jupyter, SQL, VS Code, OpenCV
- **Domains**: NLP, Time Series Forecasting, Speech Processing, Financial Modeling, Neuromorphic AI

## Interests

- Deep interest in how intelligence emerges—from neural systems to artificial models.
- Ongoing exploration of financial markets, quantitative trading, and investment analysis.
- Long-term ambition to work at the intersection of AI and investment management (quant research, private equity, algorithmic strategy).

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to discussing new ideas, research collaborations, internships, or projects involving AI, finance, or cognitive systems.
