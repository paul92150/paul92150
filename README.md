# Paul Lemaire

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m currently a Master’s student at **CentraleSupélec** (top-tier French engineering school), taking a gap year to deepen my expertise in **quantitative research and systematic trading**.  

My work explores how advanced data science and robust statistical models can drive systematic investment strategies, with a particular interest in **equity, rates, and macro-based cross-asset** products.

---

## Focus Areas

- **Systematic Trading:** signal research, alpha generation, backtesting, portfolio construction  
- **Quantitative Research:** risk modeling, cross-asset allocation, macro-driven strategies  
- **Applied Machine Learning:** time series, NLP, financial structured data

## Key Projects

### [Trading Lab](https://github.com/Paul92150/trading-lab)
A modular research framework for designing and evaluating systematic trading strategies, including momentum, mean-reversion, market cycle detection, and an interactive virtual trading simulator.  
**Extension:** Reinforcement learning agent (PPO) and a symbolic alpha module with fast vectorized evaluation.

### [J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Simulation](https://github.com/Paul92150/jpmorgan-quant-sim)
End-to-end pipelines for gas price forecasting, storage contract pricing, credit risk modeling, and FICO score bucketing, using custom loss functions and dynamic optimization inspired by production-grade workflows.

### [Photonic-Inspired Reservoir Computing](https://github.com/Paul92150/photonic-reservoir)
A neuromorphic architecture tested for time-series pattern classification and stability analysis.  
**Result:** 98.86% accuracy on MNIST.

### Neural Resume Parser (soon on Github)
A robust PDF CV parsing pipeline with CamemBERT for named entity recognition and T5-based text normalization, following production-like modular principles for real-world document processing.

## Career Goals

I am actively seeking:  
- a **Summer 2026 quantitative research internship in the US**  
- and a **6-month quantitative internship starting January 2026** (US or EU).  

Fully authorized to work in both the US and EU (French-American citizenship).
