# Paul Lemaire

Welcome to my GitHub. I’m currently a student at **CentraleSupélec** (top-tier French engineering school), pursuing my gap year with a strong focus on **quantitative research and systematic trading**.  

My projects explore the intersection of financial modeling, applied machine learning, and advanced algorithmic strategies. I’m especially motivated to leverage data science for robust, data-driven investment research and cross-asset portfolio analysis.

## Focus Areas

- **Quantitative Finance:** alpha generation, risk modeling, cross-asset portfolio strategies  
- **Systematic Trading:** signal research, backtesting, performance evaluation  
- **Applied Machine Learning:** time series, NLP, financial structured data

## Key Projects

### [Trading Lab](https://github.com/Paul92150/trading-lab)
A modular research framework for backtesting and simulating systematic trading strategies. Includes classical strategies (momentum, breakout), market cycle detection via FFT, and a virtual trading simulator.  
**Extension:** Reinforcement learning agent (PPO), and a symbolic alpha module for exploratory alpha signals with fast vectorized evaluation.

### [J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Simulation](https://github.com/Paul92150/jpmorgan-quant-sim)
Solutions to tasks on gas price forecasting, storage contract pricing, credit risk modeling, and FICO score bucketing, using robust, production-style pipelines with custom loss functions and dynamic optimization.

### [Photonic-Inspired Reservoir Computing](https://github.com/Paul92150/photonic-reservoir)
A neuromorphic architecture explored for benchmark classification and stability analysis. Included as an experimental side project, illustrating curiosity for alternative computation models.  
**Result:** 98.86% test accuracy on MNIST

### [Neural Resume Parser](https://github.com/Paul92150/resume-parser)
A PDF CV parsing pipeline combining fine-tuned CamemBERT for named entity recognition and T5-based text normalization, built for real-world robustness across messy resume formats.
