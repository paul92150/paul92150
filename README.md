# Paul Lemaire

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm currently a student at **CentraleSup√©lec** (top-tier French engineering school), pursuing my gap year with a focus on applied machine learning and quantitative research. My projects explore the intersection of artificial intelligence, brain-inspired computation, and financial systems.

## Focus Areas

- **Quantitative Finance:** strategy simulation, market analysis, portfolio modeling
- **Systematic Trading:** signal generation, backtesting, risk modeling
- **Applied Machine Learning:** time series, NLP, structured financial data

## Key Projects

### [Photonic-Inspired Reservoir Computing](https://github.com/Paul92150/photonic-reservoir)
A neuromorphic learning system simulating a quantized photonic reservoir, applied to MNIST classification and stability analysis. Includes Lyapunov-like divergence metrics, leaky integration models, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.  
**Result**: 98.86% test accuracy on MNIST (HOG + 8000-neuron reservoir)

### [VoiceChess](https://github.com/Paul92150/vocalchess)
A blindfold chess interface powered by speech recognition. Includes natural language translation of moves, fallback to engine-based evaluation, and a dynamic graphical interface for post-game review.  
**Focus**: Real-time NLP, state tracking, and human-in-the-loop decision systems

### [Trading Lab](https://github.com/Paul92150/trading-lab)
A modular framework for backtesting and simulating trading strategies. Includes classical strategies (momentum, breakout), market cycle detection via FFT, an SVM baseline, and a virtual trading simulator.  
**Extension**: Reinforcement learning agent (PPO) with BTC/USD series (excluded from Git)

### Neural Resume Parser
A robust PDF CV parsing pipeline combining a fine-tuned CamemBERT model for named entity recognition with a T5-based text normalization module. Designed for robustness across diverse document formats and multilingual input.
